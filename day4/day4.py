# conditional statements - for loop- how to print even and how to print sum

# for - used to generaate a sequence of numbers using range

#for - we can iterate strings values and indexes
# str="hello"
# print(str[0])
# print(str[1])
# print(str[4])

# for i in str:
#     print(i)#chars which are there in string


# for - we can iterate over list values and indexes
# li=["html", "css","js",123,988,398,True]
# for i in li:
#     print(i)


#for - we can iterate over dictionary values and keys
d={"name":"sachin","age":25,"city":"pune","country":"india"}

for i in d:
    print(d)
 

#break and continue
#break - break is used to terminate the loop when the loop touches the keyword
#continue - it is used to skip the particular iteration
